* Update pytest command to record new API responses üìù

Modified the pytest command in the GitHub workflow to include the `--record-mode=new_episodes` option. This change allows pytest to record new API responses, accommodating for instances where the OpenAI API calls a different host. This should improve the accuracy of our tests and coverage reports. ([`ba90ae3`](https://github.com/TechNickAI/AICodeBot/commit/ba90ae3543f3e330948e1f1d00e13d0bd4618464))

* Update tests to use VCR and pytest-recording for API mocking

Resolves #11

The tests have been updated to use the VCR package for recording and replaying API responses during testing.

This allows the tests to run without hitting the real OpenAI API, making them faster and not consuming API quota. The responses are cached in yaml files that can be committed to version control.

To enable this:

- Added a pytest fixture to configure VCR
- Updated the test decorators from `@pytest.mark.skipif` to `@pytest.mark.vcr()`
- Recorded new cassettes for each test

Now the tests will replay cached responses instead of making live calls.

This is better for CI and local testing.

* Experimental Anthropic/Claude2 support for 100k context (when using openrouter.ai)

This commit includes several changes to the `Coder` class in `coder.py` to improve how models are handled.

1. The import statement has been updated to include the `os` module. This allows us to access environment variables.
2. The method for setting the `tiktoken_model_name` has been updated to handle non-OpenAI models. For these models, the name is set to gpt-4 as a default.
3. The `get_llm_model_name` method now checks for an environment variable `AICODEBOT_LLM_MODEL`. If this variable is set, its value is used as the model name.
4. The `get_token_length` method has been updated to strip leading and trailing whitespace from the `short_text` variable.
5. The `model_options` dictionary in the `get_llm_model_name` method now includes the anthropic/claude-2 model.

These changes should make the `Coder` class more flexible and robust when dealing with different models. üöÄ ([`0c35577`](https://github.com/TechNickAI/AICodeBot/commit/0c355779258c40fbd4c7cc03ee30d3a8038a31af))

## v0.13.0 (2023-07-17)

### Unknown

* Refine token size calculation and model selection in Coder class

Resolves #25

In this commit, we&#39;ve made several adjustments to the `Coder` class in `aicodebot/coder.py` and `aicodebot/cli.py`. The token size calculation now includes a 5% buffer, down from 10%, to account for the occasional underestimation by the `tiktoken` library. The `get_token_length` method now defaults to the `gpt-4` model for token counting, and the debug output has been improved for readability.

In `aicodebot/cli.py`, we&#39;ve adjusted the `model_name` calculation in several methods to include `response_token_size` in the token count. This ensures that the selected model can handle the combined size of the request and response. In the `sidekick` method, we&#39;ve also introduced a `memory_token_size` to allow for a decent history.

These changes should improve the accuracy of model selection and prevent errors when the token count exceeds the model&#39;s limit. ([`da2fb1f`](https://github.com/TechNickAI/AICodeBot/commit/da2fb1fc1de8c7f375c1cc06e3af89d3bc899d24))

* Update pyproject.toml and requirements-dev.txt for semantic release üöÄ

This commit includes updates to the `pyproject.toml` and `requirements-dev.txt` files. The `pyproject.toml` file now includes a new section for `semantic_release` with a `version_variable` set to `aicodebot:version`. This change allows for automated versioning using the semantic-release tool.

In the `requirements-dev.txt` file, the `python-semantic-release` package has been added. This package provides the semantic-release command line tool, which automates the whole package release workflow including: determining the next version number, generating the release notes and publishing the package.

These changes aim to streamline the release process, making it more efficient and consistent. üì¶üîÑ ([`df0eda4`](https://github.com/TechNickAI/AICodeBot/commit/df0eda41cd37de4099456dc93e9998cb7c329b5c))

* Refactor &#39;commit&#39; function and enhance pre-commit checks

In the &#39;commit&#39; function, a linter warning has been suppressed by adding a &#39;noqa&#39; comment. This change suggests that the function may be complex and could benefit from further refactoring in the future.

Additionally, the pre-commit checks have been improved. Now, if the &#39;pre-commit&#39; tool is not installed, a warning message will be displayed instead of attempting to run the checks. This change enhances the robustness of the code and provides better feedback to the user. ([`d51dc0c`](https://github.com/TechNickAI/AICodeBot/commit/d51dc0c8884119c86f49a2cbf391fe40054a8139))

* Reduce test response token size and adjust review test parameters

The test response token size has been reduced from 200 to 150 to expedite testing. Additionally, the parameters for the review test have been adjusted to ensure the response is valid JSON. This includes increasing the test token size for this specific test. ([`76aca26`](https://github.com/TechNickAI/AICodeBot/commit/76aca2646c4b84c02c809a9bd3a61423446852c8))

* Refactor test_cli.py for improved readability and maintainability

The response token size for tests in test_cli.py has been extracted to a constant, TEST_RESPONSE_TOKEN_SIZE, to avoid repetition and improve readability. This change enhances the maintainability of the code by centralizing the control of this value.

* Bump version to 0.10.6 üöÄ

Just a quick version bump to keep things rolling. No major changes, just keeping up with the times! ([`e627014`](https://github.com/TechNickAI/AICodeBot/commit/e6270147d9918e21470a7c4a95832d6761f76e12))

* Enhance code review functionality in CLI and Coder üõ†Ô∏è

This commit introduces the ability to specify files for the code review command in the CLI. If no files are specified, the command will consider all staged and unstaged changes. The `git_diff_context` method in the Coder class has also been updated to accommodate this change.

In addition, the test cases have been updated to reflect these changes. This enhancement should provide more flexibility when performing code reviews. üöÄ ([`92770bc`](https://github.com/TechNickAI/AICodeBot/commit/92770bcca2e674764813b7e9f890524018da2556))

* Refine review guidelines in prompts.py üìù

Adjusted the review guidelines in `prompts.py` to provide clearer instructions. Minor changes and formatting issues are now explicitly stated to be non-discussable, and the addition of extra documentation/comments is also discouraged. The aim is to maintain focus on significant issues and code improvement. Keep it succinct, keep it relevant! üòä ([`445938f`](https://github.com/TechNickAI/AICodeBot/commit/445938f40dcc2b6cd088cef5c4b04beffbaa155a))

* Refine commit process in cli.py üõ†Ô∏è

This commit enhances the commit process in the cli.py file. We&#39;ve added a live console print to provide real-time feedback while generating the commit message. Additionally, we&#39;ve introduced a confirmation step before using the generated commit message. If not approved, the commit message can be edited in the user&#39;s preferred editor. Lastly, we&#39;ve moved the deletion of the temporary file to the end of the process to ensure it&#39;s always cleaned up. Happy coding! üöÄ ([`048d203`](https://github.com/TechNickAI/AICodeBot/commit/048d203c4907980bd2cfb6d838a4a4b81e746d37))

* Add console print for staged files to be committed

This provides better visibility for the user on what changes are about to be committed. üìùüëÄ ([`5fff8e6`](https://github.com/TechNickAI/AICodeBot/commit/5fff8e66f786d181a768e75a260cc9d56253210b))

* Enhance commit functionality in cli.py and update tests üõ†Ô∏è

This commit introduces the ability to specify files for the commit command in cli.py. Now, users can choose to commit changes from specific files, providing more flexibility. The changes also include updates to the corresponding tests to reflect this new functionality.

Additionally, minor adjustments have been made to improve code readability and maintainability. For instance, the &#39;sys.exit()&#39; calls have been replaced with &#39;return&#39; or &#39;sys.exit(0)&#39; for better clarity.

This should make the commit process more intuitive and user-friendly. Happy coding! üòä ([`6c087f2`](https://github.com/TechNickAI/AICodeBot/commit/6c087f273066020036928ac3efc97f586090c140))

* Refactor commit function and add git file handling methods

This commit refactors the `commit` function in `cli.py` to improve code readability and maintainability. It introduces two new methods in `coder.py` - `git_staged_files` and `git_unstaged_files` - to handle git file operations. The `commit` function now uses these methods to get the list of staged and unstaged files.

In addition, the commit function now confirms with the user before committing all modified files if no files are staged. It also runs pre-commit checks on the list of files to be committed, instead of all files.

The `test_cli.py` has been updated to include more comprehensive tests for the `commit` function, covering scenarios with only unstaged changes, both staged and unstaged changes, and no changes at all.

This refactor should make the code easier to understand and modify in the future. üöÄ ([`b8f3953`](https://github.com/TechNickAI/AICodeBot/commit/b8f395324831f2bbeba89f2902a10bd4f683a3ed))

* Add a function for centrally handling the engine list, with caching

This commit introduces a few key changes to the `Coder` class in `coder.py`:

1. Removed an unnecessary import and added `functools` to the import list.
2. Added a new method `get_openai_supported_engines` that fetches the list of models supported by the OpenAI API key. This method uses `functools.lru_cache` for caching the result, improving efficiency.
3. Refactored `get_llm_model_name` to use the new `get_openai_supported_engines` method, reducing code duplication and improving readability.

These changes should make the `Coder` class more efficient and easier to understand. üß†üí° ([`ab49577`](https://github.com/TechNickAI/AICodeBot/commit/ab49577cd20fc4c9b23e7350a183ff3fb0e9fff7))

* Refactor debug logging in git_diff_context method

The debug logging in the git_diff_context method of the Coder class has been refactored. The logger now uses the opt(raw=True) option when logging the diff for a specific commit. This change enhances the readability of the logged output. ([`a6782fd`](https://github.com/TechNickAI/AICodeBot/commit/a6782fd22a03d135f5dc9dc18eb8ed4223b15177))

* Refactor configuration logging and cache clearing

In this commit, the logging of the configuration file usage has been moved to the `read_config` function from the `get_config_file` function. This change ensures that the log message is only generated when the configuration file is actually read, providing a more accurate representation of the program&#39;s operations.

Additionally, the cache of the `read_config` function is now explicitly cleared in the `test_configure` function in the test suite. This ensures that each test starts with a clean state, preventing potential interference from previous tests. ([`40bb518`](https://github.com/TechNickAI/AICodeBot/commit/40bb5185b78f96d27ba35319221c68b612578162))

* Refine commit message handling and update prompts üìù

In this commit, we&#39;ve made some improvements to the way we handle commit messages. We&#39;ve added a step to remove any unwanted quotation marks from the commit message before it&#39;s written to a temporary file. This should help keep our commit messages clean and readable. üßπ

We&#39;ve also made some updates to our prompts file. We&#39;ve streamlined the &#39;Her&#39; personality description and made some changes to the commit message instructions. We&#39;ve switched from a list format to bullet points for better readability, and added some extra information about the length of the commit message. We hope these changes will make the prompts more user-friendly and informative. üìö

* Add configuration command and update key references

This commit introduces a new &#39;configure&#39; command in the build workflow, which creates or updates the config file. The &#39;openai_api_key&#39; is now fetched from the config file instead of the &#39;OPENAI_API_KEY&#39;. The &#39;personality&#39; option in the config file has also been updated to use the &#39;Her&#39; personality by default. The &#39;setup&#39; command has been removed as it&#39;s no longer needed.

Additionally, the &#39;DEFAULT_PERSONALITY&#39; has been set to &#39;Her&#39; and the &#39;PERSONALITIES&#39; keys have been updated to match the case of the personality names.

The tests have been updated to reflect these changes. The &#39;test_configure&#39; function now tests the &#39;configure&#39; command, and the &#39;test_setup_with_openai_key&#39; function has been removed as it&#39;s no longer relevant.

These changes make the configuration process more streamlined and user-friendly. üöÄ&#34; ([`33fd8b5`](https://github.com/TechNickAI/AICodeBot/commit/33fd8b5caf301ff251fa9859c62baee4afbc3bde))

* Update model selection logic in helpers.py

This commit updates the `get_llm_model` function in `helpers.py` to dynamically select the best available model based on the OpenAI API key&#39;s supported engines and the token size. The previous hard-coded model selection logic has been replaced with a more flexible approach that queries the available engines from the OpenAI API. This ensures that the most suitable model is selected for the given token size, improving the efficiency and adaptability of the code.

In addition, the commit also includes minor changes to the import statements and the logging messages to accommodate the updated model selection logic.

Remember, the future is not set in stone. It&#39;s a wildly malleable thing that&#39;s still very much in the works. And you, dear developer, are one of the many hands that get to shape it. Let&#39;s keep coding a better future together! ([`4465984`](https://github.com/TechNickAI/AICodeBot/commit/44659846c2f1a47ec6b5a92cdedb80d932a584c8))

* Enhanced file context generation in prompts

This commit ain&#39;t just about adding or removing a few lines of code. It&#39;s about giving a damn about the context. We&#39;ve added a function to generate a directory structure, and we&#39;re using it to provide a more comprehensive context for the sidekick prompt. Now, not only do you get the relevant files, but you also get a nice little map of the directory structure. Ain&#39;t that something?

And let&#39;s not forget about the files. We&#39;ve improved the way we handle them too. If there ain&#39;t no files, we don&#39;t just leave you hanging. We give you the directory structure and call it a day. But if there are files, oh boy, we give you the whole shebang. We read &#39;em, we count &#39;em, and we warn you if they&#39;re too damn big.

So, in summary, we&#39;ve made the file context generation in prompts more informative and more useful. And if you don&#39;t appreciate that, well, I don&#39;t know what to tell you. ([`17a3daf`](https://github.com/TechNickAI/AICodeBot/commit/17a3dafed60d417508af1d5f5aedbdc2d48536ca))

* Add directory structure generator and refactor tests

Alright, listen up. We&#39;ve got some new shit in town. We&#39;ve added a badass function to generate a directory structure, and it&#39;s got all the bells and whistles. It respects .gitignore, it can ignore patterns, and it&#39;s got a pretty print for your viewing pleasure.

We&#39;ve also been cleaning up the house. Moved the create_and_write_file function to conftest.py, cause that&#39;s where it belongs. It&#39;s a utility function, and it&#39;s gonna be used in multiple test files.

Speaking of tests, we&#39;ve added a whole bunch of them for the new directory structure generator. We&#39;re making sure this function is bulletproof.

And lastly, we&#39;ve done some minor text changes in prompts.py and conftest.py. Nothing to lose your shit over.

So there you have it. New features, better tests, cleaner code. That&#39;s how we roll. ([`0064c80`](https://github.com/TechNickAI/AICodeBot/commit/0064c80a0ada701f77e417edf4ea16d1931ecb90))

* Adjust response token size and tweak precise temperature

Alright, listen up. We&#39;ve got some changes here. First off, we&#39;ve adjusted the response token size in the &#39;fun_fact&#39; and &#39;sidekick&#39; functions. This means the AI&#39;s response length can now be controlled more precisely. Ain&#39;t that some shit?

Next, we&#39;ve tweaked the precise temperature from 0 to 0.1. This little change is gonna make the AI&#39;s responses a bit more varied, but still on the sensible side.

We&#39;ve also made some minor changes to the &#39;debug&#39; and &#39;alignment&#39; tests, and added a new test for the &#39;sidekick&#39; function.

Lastly, we&#39;ve cleaned up the &#39;DEBUG_TEMPLATE&#39; in prompts.py. No big deal, just made it a bit more concise.

So there you have it. Changes made, commit done. Now let&#39;s get back to work. ([`8cc6ad8`](https://github.com/TechNickAI/AICodeBot/commit/8cc6ad857a82f8021842ae9fa6b2408e4716bdc9))

* Add personality selection to AICodeBot setup

This commit introduces a new feature to the AICodeBot setup process. Now, users can select a personality for their AI assistant from a predefined list. The chosen personality is stored in the configuration file and used to generate the AI&#39;s responses. This change also includes a refactoring of the personality prompts, moving them into a dictionary for easier access and management. Ain&#39;t no half-steppin&#39; here, we&#39;re making this bot a real cool cat. ([`6d03446`](https://github.com/TechNickAI/AICodeBot/commit/6d034468e73bb8c2fe56626cd0592d9b5b1c00d9))

* Add keywords to setup.py üóùÔ∏è

In this commit, we&#39;ve added a `keywords` field to the `setup()` function in `setup.py`. This field contains a string of keywords that describe the project: &#34;AI, coding, assistant, pair-programming, automation&#34;. This will help improve the discoverability of our project on platforms like PyPI. üïµÔ∏è‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏èüîç ([`7f0e817`](https://github.com/TechNickAI/AICodeBot/commit/7f0e8178d94276057c1d06e32417cf5cc72ac36f))

* Refactor configuration handling, add setup command. Resolves #3

This commit introduces a significant overhaul of the configuration handling in the AICodeBot. The OpenAI API key is no longer fetched directly from the environment variables in the cli.py file. Instead, a new helper function, get_config_file, has been added to helpers.py. This function checks if the AICODEBOT_CONFIG_FILE environment variable is set and uses its value as the path to the configuration file. If the environment variable is not set, it defaults to using a file named .aicodebot.yaml in the user&#39;s home directory.

The setup command in cli.py has been updated to use this new function. It now also accepts a new option, --gpt-4-supported, which is a flag indicating whether the user has access to GPT-4. This information is stored in the configuration file along with the OpenAI API key.

The setup_config function in cli.py has been updated to reflect these changes. It now accepts two arguments: the OpenAI API key and a boolean indicating whether GPT-4 is supported. If the OpenAI API key is not provided, the function will attempt to fetch it from the environment variables or prompt the user to enter it. The function then validates the API key and checks if GPT-4 is supported (unless the --gpt-4-supported flag was used). The configuration data is then written to the configuration file.

The read_config function in helpers.py has also been updated to use the new get_config_file function.

Finally, tests have been added to test_cli.py to test the new setup command and the changes to the configuration handling. ([`924b8c6`](https://github.com/TechNickAI/AICodeBot/commit/924b8c68ccd25785e76edcb24939c2eb22a45ff1))

* Refactor configuration and dependency management. Resolves #19

In the realm of code, change is the only constant. In this instance, we have embarked on a journey of transformation, a metamorphosis of sorts. The configuration management has been refactored, shifting from environment variables to a more robust YAML-based configuration file. This change brings with it the promise of greater flexibility and ease of use.

In addition, the dependencies have been pruned. The python-dotenv package, once a vital part of our ecosystem, has been replaced by PyYAML, a more versatile and powerful tool for handling configuration data.

The code has been adjusted to accommodate these changes, with the OPENAI_API_KEY now being read from the new configuration file. This key is the bridge between our humble code and the vast knowledge of the OpenAI API, and its handling is of utmost importance.

In the grand tapestry of our codebase, these changes may seem minor, but remember, even the smallest thread can change the pattern of the weave. ([`fce0488`](https://github.com/TechNickAI/AICodeBot/commit/fce04880e1d86e2f6e0cafc9689ae0e17075825a))

* Expand the realm of personalities, refine the prompt generation

In the vast expanse of our code, we have ventured to broaden the spectrum of personalities that our AI can embody. Sherlock, The Dude, and Morpheus have joined the ranks, each bringing their unique essence to the table.

The method of generating prompts has been refined, transitioning from a series of conditional statements to a more efficient mapping. This change not only enhances readability but also simplifies the process of adding new commands in the future.

Furthermore, we have fortified our code against the unknown. In the event of an unrecognized personality or command, our code will now raise a more informative error, guiding us towards the path of resolution.

Remember, developer, the code is a living entity, evolving and growing with each commit. This change is but a step in its journey towards perfection. ([`1b346b8`](https://github.com/TechNickAI/AICodeBot/commit/1b346b8b86af56b8a464f363fff81bd2a3b4901f))

* Bump version to 0.8.1 ([`a0670af`](https://github.com/TechNickAI/AICodeBot/commit/a0670afc3852097ab47bbab38165fcae3113db0e))

* Refactor prompt handling and add personality traits

This commit is a major overhaul of the prompt handling system. We&#39;ve ditched the old yaml-based prompts and moved everything into a single Python file, `prompts.py`. This makes it easier to manage and modify prompts on the fly.

We&#39;ve also added a new feature: personality traits. Now, the bot can have different personalities, like Jules from Pulp Fiction or the AI from Her. This is controlled by an environment variable, so you can switch personalities without changing the code.

The `cli.py` file has been updated to use the new prompt system. The `alignment` command now takes a `response_token_size` option, which lets you control the length of the bot&#39;s responses.

Finally, we&#39;ve cleaned up the test suite a bit. The `alignment` test now uses the new `response_token_size` option, and we&#39;ve added a check to skip certain tests if the OpenAI API key isn&#39;t set.

This is a big change, but it&#39;s a good one. It makes the bot more flexible and easier to use. So buckle up, because this is just the beginning. ([`109a901`](https://github.com/TechNickAI/AICodeBot/commit/109a90102e52150540ddc731050c7137f10f0473))

* Refactor get_llm_model and add token size checks üîÑüîç

This commit moves the `get_llm_model` function from `cli.py` to `helpers.py` for better code organization. It also introduces token size checks in various functions in `cli.py` to ensure the token size does not exceed the model&#39;s capacity. If the token size is too large, an exception is raised with a helpful error message. üöÄüìè

In `prompts/sidekick.py`, token length is now logged for each file in the context, providing useful debugging information. üìäüîç

These changes improve the robustness of the code and provide better feedback to the user when the token size is too large. üõ†Ô∏èüëç ([`48e328d`](https://github.com/TechNickAI/AICodeBot/commit/48e328d53c1266fc9ad81ab928d23fe61f62dad1))

* Enhance logging and add personality selection üé≠üîç

This commit introduces several enhancements to the codebase:

- Added `loguru` for improved logging throughout the application. This will help in better debugging and understanding the flow of the application. üïµÔ∏è‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è
- Logging levels can now be controlled via the `LOG_LEVEL` environment variable. This allows for flexible control over the verbosity of logs. üéöÔ∏è
- Added logging statements in various parts of the code to provide more context during execution. This includes logging the token length of text, the diff for commits, and the execution of commands. üìù
- Introduced the ability to select the AI&#39;s personality via the `AICODEBOT_PERSONALITY` environment variable. This adds a fun and customizable aspect to the AI&#39;s responses. üé≠
- Updated the requirements to include `loguru`. üì¶

* Expand personality options and fix typo üé≠üîß

In this commit, we&#39;ve made some exciting changes to our `personalities.py` file. We&#39;ve corrected a small typo in the description of the &#39;Her&#39; personality, changing &#39;fro&#39; to &#39;from&#39; üïµÔ∏è‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è.

But that&#39;s not all! We&#39;ve also introduced a new personality, &#39;Jules&#39; from Pulp Fiction, to our repertoire üé¨. This addition will allow for a more diverse range of interactions and responses.

Lastly, we&#39;ve updated the `get_personality_prompt` function to accept a parameter, allowing the user to choose the personality they want to interact with. If no personality is specified, &#39;Her&#39; will be the default choice.

This is a step forward in making our AI more versatile and engaging. Stay tuned for more updates! üöÄ ([`564fd76`](https://github.com/TechNickAI/AICodeBot/commit/564fd76e436ab72023a61c05dc4b906cf4c1e0f9))

* Enhance user interaction with editor choice and input options üéõÔ∏è

In this commit, we&#39;ve made some user-friendly enhancements to the CLI interaction. Now, the user&#39;s preferred editor, as specified by the `EDITOR` environment variable, is used for editing tasks. If no editor is specified, we default to vim. The prompt message has been updated to reflect this change. üìù

Additionally, we&#39;ve introduced a new way to trigger the edit mode. If the user&#39;s input ends with `\e`, the input text (excluding `\e`) will be opened in the editor for further modification. This provides a more flexible way for users to edit their input. üîÑ

As always, the user can quit the program by entering `q`. These changes aim to make the interaction more intuitive and user-friendly. Happy coding! üöÄ ([`fe95fdc`](https://github.com/TechNickAI/AICodeBot/commit/fe95fdc40b22d176aed67b8212b1d30b38e44d41))

* Add AI Sidekick feature description to README.md ([`26dca3b`](https://github.com/TechNickAI/AICodeBot/commit/26dca3b0e20c58afa7a07599f8873397bb416115))

* Bump version to 0.8.0 - introduce sidekick ([`c62896b`](https://github.com/TechNickAI/AICodeBot/commit/c62896b5208a92a1fb092f0788b0d13c9429338c))

* Enhance AI sidekick with file context support üìÅ

This commit introduces the ability for the AI sidekick to use the contents of specified files as context during its session. This is achieved by adding a new function `generate_files_context` which reads the contents of the provided files and formats them into a string that can be used as context.

The `sidekick` function in `cli.py` has been updated to accept a list of files as arguments, generate the file context, and pass it along with the user&#39;s request to the `generate_sidekick_prompt` function. The token size calculations and model selection have also been adjusted to account for the additional context.

The `generate_sidekick_prompt` function now accepts an additional `files` parameter and includes the generated file context in the prompt template. The prompt template itself has been updated to include a placeholder for the file context.

The import statements in `cli.py` and `__init__.py` have been updated to include the new `generate_files_context` function.

This enhancement provides the AI sidekick with more context, potentially improving its ability to assist the user. ([`667240a`](https://github.com/TechNickAI/AICodeBot/commit/667240a5387ab5dc7ae107bf9e9fadfa1869a9d9))

* Update model selection logic to support GPT-4 üöÄ

This commit introduces changes to the model selection logic in the AI code bot. Previously, the bot was hardcoded to use the GPT-3.5-turbo model. Now, the bot checks if GPT-4 is supported by the provided OpenAI API key and uses it if available. If GPT-4 is not supported, the bot falls back to using GPT-3.5-turbo.

The model selection is also now dynamic based on the token size of the request. The bot selects the largest model that supports the required token size. This ensures that the bot can handle larger contexts while still using the most powerful model available.

Additionally, a new environment variable `GPT_4_SUPPORTED` has been added to the `.aicodebot.template` file to store the GPT-4 support status of the API key. This value is set during the setup process when the API key is validated.

This update enhances the bot&#39;s capabilities and prepares it for future improvements in the OpenAI models. ([`a52de62`](https://github.com/TechNickAI/AICodeBot/commit/a52de626cb3b57294d419cf652b119ec287c049d))
