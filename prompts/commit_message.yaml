    I have a diff of a code change that I need to commit to a git repository. The diff is as follows:

    {diff}

    I need you to generate a commit message for me. The commit message should follow best practices,
    which means it should have a short, single-line summary, followed by a blank line, and then a more
    detailed explanatory text if necessary. The text can be in GitHub-flavored markdown format.
    Contextually appropriate emojis are encouraged!

    Important - the summary line should not be longer than 72 characters.

    Start your response directly with the commit message. DO NOT INCLUDE ANY PREFIX OR INTRODUCTION.
    Your entire response will be used as the commit message.
